1. The Gaming Room is a customer who owns a game called Draw It or Lose It, exclusively available as an Android app. They intend to create a web-based version of the app that can be accessed on various platforms. In this game, the teams will be presented with image clues to guess a puzzle. There will be four rounds, each lasting one minute. The images will load consistently, completing at the 30-second mark. If a team fails to guess the puzzle within the time limit, the other teams will have a 15-second opportunity to solve it. The software requirements are as follows: the game must support one or more teams, each team can have multiple players, unique names for games and teams, and only one instance of a game can be active in memory at any given time.
2. I believe I performed well in the recommendation section of this document. My responses and reasoning were meticulously detailed and comprehensive.
3. Engaging with a design document can be incredibly beneficial during the code development process. By outlining software requirements, design limitations, and incorporating a domain model with a UML diagram, the document provides valuable guidance. This comprehensive information greatly assists in the code construction phase by presenting a clear roadmap of tasks to be accomplished, eliminating the need to search multiple sources for the required answers.
4. If I were to select a section of this document to revise, it would be the evaluations of the development requirements. I believe there are opportunities to enhance clarity and effectively convey my perspective. Although I have already proposed certain modifications to the document, I acknowledge that there is always room for improvement.
5. Ensuring a thorough understanding of the user's requirements and integrating them into the software design is crucial. I achieved this by carefully considering both the software and design prerequisites, as well as the existing features of the game in the app. Another approach to interpreting the user's needs is to empathize with them and envision what additional elements would enhance their experience beyond the mandatory requirements. It is vital to prioritize the user's needs, as they ultimately become your clients. By delivering a positive user experience, they are more likely to share their satisfaction with others and show interest in your future creations. This not only generates more business for the designer but also serves as a determinant of project success.
6. I utilized object-oriented design principles and employed a software design template while creating this software. I found that these techniques synergized effectively. Whenever I engage in a project that involves an object-oriented programming language, I prefer to adopt an object-oriented design approach. This methodology simplifies the process of segregating and grouping code, making it more convenient to modify and extend as needed.
